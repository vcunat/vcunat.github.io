Data Structures 1 - NTIN066 - WS 2014/2015
<h2>HW 3</h2>


<b>Due date:</b> 15. 12. 2014<p>

<h3>Problem description</h3>
Implement lazy binomial heaps. Create a program which reads the test data from the standard input and with each Delete-Min operation it outputs the deleted minimum.
The input data are partitioned into runs. Each run constists of a sequence of Insert and Delete-Min operations. The Insert operation starts by the character 'I' in the input. The Delete-Min operation starts with 'D'. The last row of the run is the character 'R'. After each run (at the end of the input) there is a row with the character 'X'.
The inserted elements are from the interval [0, n - 1]. After each run the binomial heap is emptied. Each run should be saparated by a newline in the output.

<p>
Using unix executable <tt>/afs/ms.mff.cuni.cz/u/k/koucky/ds1/pbl3-gen-data</tt> which is available in Rotunda laboratory you can generate test data. 

Test your implementation using those data and for each run measure the overall number of merges during Delete-Min operation. Then measure the count N of Insert operations and the number D of Delete-Min operations.

Create a graph (each run is a point): 
<ul>
	<li>The <i>x</i> axis is N - the number of insertions.</li>
    <li>The axis <i>y</i> shows (S-min(S,N))/D.</li>
</ul>
That is create a graph of the average number of merges per deletion.
The graph should have five curves for five test data.
Also try to explain the graph.

</p><h3>Input example</h3>
<pre>
I 1 
I 3
D
I 2
D
I 0
R
I 2
I 3
I 0
I 1
D
R
X
</pre>

<h3>Output</h3>

<h3>Generating the input data</h3>
<tt>$/afs/ms.mff.cuni.cz/u/k/koucky/ds1/pbl3-gen-data XX D</tt>
<p>This will generate data for measuring, remember that XX are the last two number of your student number and D is one of  {0,1000,10000,100000,1000000} (the five curves).
If D=0, then we perform Delete-Min just after all insertions until the heap is emptied.
When D&lt;0, then Delete-Min operations are uniformly positioned among N Insert operations.
Each run has at least 1 000 inserts and runs up to 1 000 000 insertions. There are approximately 300 runs.
Example:

<pre>
pbl3-gen-data 72 0       | my-heap
pbl3-gen-data 72 1000    | my-heap
pbl3-gen-data 72 10000   | my-heap
pbl3-gen-data 72 100000  | my-heap
pbl3-gen-data 72 1000000 | my-heap
</pre>
